# Modern-Art-Board-Game
## Running the game
The game cannot be run at the moment because I am switching from a command line program to a GUI.

## Notes about this project
This is a reasearch project about devloping AI for a board game that is not as deterministic as a game like chess or connect 4. With that being said, the game may be slightly incomplete and is not ment for human interaction at this time. A little more detail about it being incomplete is that it may not account for all of the edge cases properly, the game itself works well enough where AIs can be tested and possible trained on.

## About the players
The players in the player package are snapshots of different ideas. They will be kept around but probably no longer updated. I will be using them to judge how well the future AIs act. The only exceptions to this are the Random and Human players.

## Other notes
Files in the bin folder should always have the newest version. Also due to me coding on a windows machine, I am pushing debug updates that I am pulling to a linux teminal, so some updates may not work properly. The JavaDoc is not complete and I will be updating it hopfully within the next 2 weeks.

## Currently WIP
It has become hard to really see what is going on in the program through only command line interfaces. I am working on a GUI that will be able to show much more info at a time and it will be far esier to read. This will take some time and until it is done there will not be any updates to the AIs.

As of now, the Main class does not work and will not work in the future. It was based on the idea that this program will be a command line program and would not have a GUI. It will be removed in the future along with other nonGUI based classes
