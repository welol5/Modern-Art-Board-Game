# Modern-Art-Board-Game
## Running the game
To run the game, simply run the Main class after the code is compiled.

## Notes about this project
This is a reasearch project about devloping AI for a board game that is not as deterministic as a game like chess or connect 4. With that being said, the game may be slightly incomplete and is not ment for human interaction at this time. A little more detail about it being incomplete is that it may not account for all of the edge cases properly, the game itself works well enough where AIs can be tested and possible trained on.

Files in the bin folder should always have the newest version

## Currently WIP
I am working on cleaning up the code
