# Modern-Art-Board-Game
## Running the game
To run the game, simply run the Main class after the code is compiled.

## Notes about this project
This is a reasearch project about devloping AI for a board game that is not as deterministic as a game like chess or connect 4. With that being said, the game may be slightly incomplete and is not ment for human interaction at this time. A little more detail about it being incomplete is that it may not account for all of the edge cases properly, the game itself works well enough where AIs can be tested and possible trained on.

## Abou the players
The players in the player package are snapshots of different ideas. They will be kept around but probably no longer updated. I will be using them to judge how well the future AIs act. The only exceptions to this are the Random and Human players.

## Other notes
Files in the bin folder should always have the newest version

## Currently WIP
I am working on cleaning up the code
Currently trying to remove the data stored in OGS
