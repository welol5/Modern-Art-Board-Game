Heuristic on how to predict what cards other players will play
	-assume that the player will play the artist that will make them the most money at the end of the season
	and assume that the season will end there even if no artist is at 5.
	-This leaves the question of who buys the cards?
With this also add in a confidence percentage = highest artist count * 0.25
	-use this as a multiplier for the price a player is willing to bid.
